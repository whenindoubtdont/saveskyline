    "body": "Subject: Skyline park needs your help!\n\nArchers,\n      Maybe you can help us/ You by contacting the people in the email links below about this skyline park issue, we need all we can get to contact them. It takes 5 minutes to copy and paste these emails and the result may be we save skyline park. We have to stand up now, its only a matter of time before they will come back and take more, and eventually the club. For now they want about half of the flat area where we hold the pow wows, SCA events, boy scouts camping events, bottle rock, equestrian shows, open space for fire crews to create base camp etc. Napa is also proposing another tax increase to buy \"open space\" for a fire base camp, which is already there in skyline if they don't develop it into low income housing as planned.\n       A few years ago the city wanted us at the park to endorse another tax increase under measure Z, this tax increase was to provide money for parks and open spaces, when we researched it, the park got like 2% or less of that money so we didn't endorse it as it seemed just another way to scam tax payers out of the money while the money doesn't go where it says it will. Because we didn't endorse it they sent in their lobbyists to hassle us about everything that we did at the park. I didn't realize their bigger play was to basically badger us until we couldn't take it anymore and I resigned, then they swung the vote and voted Dorothy glaros out of the presidency, and put people in that dont seem to be putting up any fight in this matter. Sadly I didn't realize that was so that they could then take this land that we tax payers paid for and sell it off for profit to a developer to put in even more high density low income housing, get the federal kick backs and worst of all……charge the park thousands per day to use it until they do develop it. Please please take a moment to reach out to these people and please take a moment to spread the word as best as possible to all that you know, that the park is owned by the citizens for many uses and its being sold out from under us and they are ignoring the will of the people."

This 5-acre project is the first slice.\n- The developer (PEP Housing / Collective Operations LLC) was selected by the state — Napa County opposed the removal of this land from the park.\n- Napa County just purchased the remaining 874 acres for $7.26M in December 2024 to preserve it as open space. The state is now carving out the most-used flat area for development.\n- This land hosts wildfire crew base camps, Suscol Intertribal Council pow wows, Boy Scout camping, equestrian events, BottleRock overflow, and archery ranges.\n- Revenue from the flat areas funds the entire park's trail maintenance and operations.\n- The Sierra Club Napa Group has opposed this since 2022, calling the park \"irreplaceable.\"\n\nSkyline Park belongs to the citizens of Napa. Please help us protect it.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\nNapa County Resident",
