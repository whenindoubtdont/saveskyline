The state wants to build 185 dense affordable housing units on 5.26 acres of the flat event area we taxpayers own and use for archery, pow wows, scouts, equestrian, fire base camps, and more.\n\nThis is the same land we preserved. The county just bought the rest of the park to \"protect open space\" while this gets developed. Irony much?\n\nWe said no to Measure Z because the money didn't go to parks. Now they're punishing us by selling the park out from under us.\n\nPlease cover this story and help stop it. Contact the supervisors. Spread the word.\n\nSkyline Park belongs to the citizens of Napa — not developers.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\nNapa Resident / Silverado Archers supporter",
